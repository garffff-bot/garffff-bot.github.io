**Unconstrained Delegation** is a configuration in Active Directory environments where a service account can impersonate users to access other services. It works by allowing the service to obtain and use the Kerberos tickets (TGTsâ€”Ticket Granting Tickets) of users who authenticate to it, enabling potential unauthorised access to network resources.
