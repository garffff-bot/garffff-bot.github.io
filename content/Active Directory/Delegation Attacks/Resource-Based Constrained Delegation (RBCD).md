**Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)** is a delegation method in Active Directory environments where control over delegation is assigned to the resource. It works by allowing a resource (like a server) to specify which accounts can impersonate users to access that resource using their Kerberos tickets (TGSâ€”Ticket Granting Service).
