#### ExtraSids Attack

As with the Windows, we need the following information:

- The KRBTGT hash for the child domain
- The SID for the child domain
- The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist!)
- The FQDN of the child domain
- The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain
